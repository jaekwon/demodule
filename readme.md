# Demodule

Kinda like browserify, but packaging is configured globally at the project level.
Makes smaller javascript packages, allows user to choose what files to package.
Not for the faint of heart.

Included are some builtins from the browserify project.

## Development

Install the CoffeeScript compiler, then:
``` bash
  cake build
```
